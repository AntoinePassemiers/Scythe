# Scythe

[Under development] Machine learning library for fitting gradient boosted trees and 
deep forests.

## TODO

* [ID3] Set the minimum number of instances per leaf as a parameter
* Being able to pass non-contiguous Numpy arrays to the C API (not sure if necessary)
* [ClassificationForest] Create a cross-validation function
* [ClassificationForest] Create a predict function
* [ClassificationForest] Use Friedman's formula to compute the gradient
* Adapt the code of the ClassificationForest to create a RegressionForest class
